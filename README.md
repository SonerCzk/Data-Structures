# Data-Structures

Objectives of a program:
[Search] My program can search for any given password in the 100,000 password list and return if the given password is in the list or not.
[Sort] My program can sort the 10.000 password list ascending and descending order. Show top 10 elements in both order.
[Hash] My program adds 1.000 password list in to a hash table with appropriate hash function that had maximum 200 collusion.
 And it searches password within 1.000 password list using Hash Table and report collusion count for that search.
[Linked List] I created a linked list from 1.000 password list.According to password lenght and difference of every character,
 i give every password a score and store these scores in the same linked list.And i sorted the list according to the 
password strenght and output top 10 strongest and top 10 most weakest passwords.
